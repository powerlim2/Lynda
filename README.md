# Lynda.com

This is a repo for my Lynda.com course works. Courses at Lynda.com tend to be light-weight and are less theoretical but very practical. This is the major difference of Lynda.com from Coursera courses. I use Lynda.com for learning front-end and back-end web dev concepts and tools.

## My course works:

- Node.js
- jQuery
