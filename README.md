# Lynda.com

This is a repo for my Lynda.com courseworks. Courses at Lynda.com tend to be light-weight and less theoretical but very practical. This is the point where I feel Lynda.com courses are greatly different from Coursera courses. I use Lynda.com for learning front-end and back-end web dev concepts and tools.
